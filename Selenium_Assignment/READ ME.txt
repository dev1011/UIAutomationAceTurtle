Hello,

This project automates UI of a basic scenario of https.in.puma.com and api of developer.git.com/v3

This is developed using maven, selenium web driver for chrome and testng and httpcomponents
The framework is testng and page object model.

The execution through testng xml file is paraeterised in pom and the paramter for testng file can be passed 
through maven command, if the project has multiple testng files, for example for smoke , regression and api,
it can be acieved with this approach.

Command for executing UI Automation: mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=web.xml
Command for executing API Automation: mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=api.xml
(Pre Requiste: Maven setup and JDK 8 should be available with
This can also be done by executing respective batch files which is in the same folder.

PS: There could have been better code and coding practices but since there was a time contraint where 
I got few hours to setup framework and code the tests, there could be some glitches. 
One of them, which I observed (very rare) is the mouse hover on the main menu 
in puma.com ("Men/Shoes/Running")

Thanks!
Devendra
