Hello,

This project automates a basic scenario of https.in.puma.com.

This is developed using maven, selenium web driver for chrome and testng.
The framework is page object model.

The execution through testng.xml is paraeterised in pom and the paramter for testng file can be passed 
on the command below, if the project has multiple testng file, for example for smoke and regression, 
it can be acieved with this approach.

Command: mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml

This can also be done by executing execute.bat file which is in the same folder.

Thanks!
Devendra
